<h1 align="center">CPU Scheduling Simulator</h1>

### Description
`C++ Program` to simulate different `Operating System Scheduling Algorithms` using dup/dup2, fork, exec, and inter-process communication primitives. 

### Algorithms Implemented
- Round Robin (RR)
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)

### Manual
1) Use the following command to `Compile the Code`:
    ```
    g++ 5_state_model_simulator.cpp
    ```

2) Use the following command to `Run the Code`:
    ```
    ./a.out
    ```
3) You can `Change Processes` in the files named as Sample_1_RR.txt, Sample_2_FCFS.txt, Sample_4_SJF.txt
4) You can see `Final Output` i.e, throughput, average waiting time, average turnaround time in the file named as `processes_stats.txt`
